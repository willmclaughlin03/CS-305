# CS-305

Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address?

Artemis Financial was a financial company who needed security on their customers data in the form of encryption, as well as ways to securely store and access the data.

What did you do very well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall wellbeing?

I believe I did very well on analyzing and choosing the best options for security, as well as addressing vulnerablities that could occur. Coding securely is so important because data is involved in everything, and hackers and exploiters are everywhere in the current day. Making sure that code is secure, and breaches are unlikely to ever occur is not only important, but it brings value to a companies wellbeing by ensuring people can trust the company, and do business with them. 

What part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?

Certainly creating the secure code and transferring the data to the webpage. Refactoring the code multiple times to try and make it as secure as possible, figuring out what was wrong with it each time was a challenge.

How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?

I increased levels of security by adding in greater and greater security verifications and certificates, like SSL and trusted authentication abilites. 

How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?

I checked to see if I had introduced new vulnerabilites by running Maven tests, and running a vulnerability report multiple times. This is how I checked to see if my application was secure and functional, along with adding the needed verificartion processes and refactorings.

What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?

All of the security features, especially figuring out how to run security vulnerablity tests, I feel the knowledge of that will be extremely important in the future.

Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?

I would show them my analysis of vulnerabilites, as well as how I figured out how to address them through code and verification processes as well.
